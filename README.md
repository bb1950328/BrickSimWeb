## BrickSimWeb

All the content for [BrickSim.org](https://BrickSim.org) is here. A [workflow](https://github.com/bb1950328/BrickSimWeb/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Hugo+Static+Site+Build%22)
is triggered after every push to this repo. It generates the site and pushes it to the [BrickSim/docs](https://github.com/bb1950328/BrickSim/tree/master/docs) folder.

Please open issues in the main repository and add the [documentation/web](https://github.com/bb1950328/BrickSim/labels/documentation%2Fweb) label.
