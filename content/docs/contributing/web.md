The webpages are built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator that turns markdown into HTML.
The [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/bb1950328) has a [Actions workflow](https://github.com/bb1950328/BrickSimWeb/blob/master/.github/workflows/hugo_build.yml) that automatically updates the website whenever a change is pushed to the master branch.
Theoretically it's possible to just write the content and create a pull request, but if you install hugo locally you can preview your changes before you commit them. Follow [this tutorial](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) to install hugo on your system.  

If you want to contribute to the website, fork `bb1950328/BrickSimWeb`, make your changes and submit a pull request.
