If you want to contribute to the code, you should know the following things:
* How [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en) works
* How to code in [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
* How [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) works (The Demo is included in BrickSim, the best way for me was to play around and then Ctrl+F for a display text to quickly navigate to the corresponding code lines)

If you don't know one of the technologies yet, there are many tutorials on the internet.

If you have an idea or a bug, please make a [new issue](https://github.com/bb1950328/BrickSim/issues/new) 
and describe it as detailed as possible. Also mention that you want to implement it yourself. 
The maintainers will give you their OK if the issue is valid. After that you can start coding.
This way you don't waste time for something which we won't accept.

Of course, we accept as much as possible, but if something does not make sense, it is better not to accept it.

Before you start, make sure you read the following documents:
* [Technical documentation](../../technical_info).
* [Code style](./code_style)
